## Interview Instructions

- Please make use of any documentation available online, however, kindly refrain from copying and pasting code snippets.
- Please make sure to attempt each item listed below as some items may have more weight than others.
- This exercise is built with Angular v17.x and it makes use of the following features
  - Standalone Components & `Input` binding to Route params & data.
  - Guards, Resolvers & HTTP Interceptors are still using the traditional class-based syntax.
  - Control Flow using `@if` & `@for` instead of `*ngIf` & `*ngFor`.
- This interview is assessed based on:
  - critical thinking.
  - optimized implementation.
  - technical knowledge.

### Components & Services

1. Create a new service `TranslateService` inside `src/services` with the following 2 methods:
   1. `getContent`: takes a string `lang` and retrieve the content for that language from `assets` directory.
      1. Should be called only once.
      2. Retrieved content is stored for reusability.
   2. `getValue`: takes a string `key` and returns its mapped value from the content.
      1. For this logic, please make use of the `get` method of `lodash`.
2. Create a new pipe `TranslatePipe` inside `src/pipes`
   1. The pipe should retrieve the value for the key provided from the service.
3. Configure the `ListComponent` to do the following:
   1. Ensure the list/card/paginator should fill exactly half the width of the page.
   2. Navigate to the last page, make sure the paginator should always stay in the same position below the list.
   3. When an item is clicked, call the `getPokemonDetails` from `AppService` to retrieve its details.
   4. The item details will populate the `selected` object to display the details card beside the list.
   5. A new css class with the name `selected` should be added to that item.
4. Configure the `DetailsComponent` to do the following:
   1. Navigate to page `3`, select `Arbok`, ensure a single line of text per ability, and the abilities are not overflowing the card.
   2. Make use of the new `translate` pipe to display content properly.
   3. The `Back` button should show up only when you are in the details page.
5. Configure the `EditorComponent` to do the following:
   1. Make use of the new `translate` pipe to display content properly.
   2. The `Back` button should show up only when you are in each respective page.

### Forms, Routing & Advanced Components

1. Configure the `EditorComponent` to do the following:
   1. Prefill the form value with the details passed to the component.
   2. Make sure the `name` input is not being validated while the user is still typing
   3. Update the `crossFieldValidator` function to throw a new `crossField` error if the `name` field is invalid.
2. Configure the application routing so that:
   1. Navigate to `/#/details/xyz` or `/#/editor/xyz`, you should be getting a `404` Http error, in this case you should redirect to `/#/error`.
   2. Navigate to `/#/list/150`, you will be getting a `200` Http response with no results, in the case you should also redirect to `/#/error`.
   3. Add a new `list` route that takes both `pageNo` & `name` to load the list & details at the same time, verify by navigating to `/#/list/3/Arbok`.
3. Configure the `CardComponent` to do the following:
   1. A new css class of `modal` should be added to the component dom when `showAsModal` is passed as `true`.
   2. The close icon `‚ùå` should show up only in modal view and when pressed it should close the modal.
   3. When in modal mode, if any click is triggered outside the card, it should close the modal.

### Advanced Forms & Application Configuration

1. Configure the `InputComponent` to do the following:
   1. Using the proper Reactive Forms concepts of Angular, remove the `form` input completely
2. Configure the `EditorComponent` to do the following:
   1. Display the abilities & types as inputs instead of regular text and make sure the add & delete buttons work properly.
3. Configure the Angular application to do the following:
   1. Call `getContent` method **before** the application loads up, for when any page is rendered, the content should already be there.
   2. Whenever an HTTP request is made, log information about that request, specifically the request _method_, _url_, _success_ & _time consumed in milliseconds_, e.g. `GET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=10&offset=0 succeeded in 5ms`.
   3. Update the `getContent` method to not be included in that behavior.
